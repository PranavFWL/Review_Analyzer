This is a review analyzer which categorizes text into five categories: Worst, Bad, Average, Good, and Excellent. 
You can pass a review one at a time or create a CSV file of multiple reviews and pass all of them at once. For example, a CSV file named 'SentiData.csv' has been provided, which contains sample reviews. 
The model will give the count of all the sentiments.
